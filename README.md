Data visualisation from my favourite FIFA career mode save detailing player performance. 

Using data I collected during Lockdown whilst playing hours and hours of EA Sports FIFA franchise, I used Python's Bokeh library to create a graph of my most productive players throughout all of my career mode saves.

The chart measures player productivity based on goals and assists per 90 minutes (per game) over the course of each players best season. 
This was a very fun project to undertake and I look foward to experimenting with data visualisation more.
